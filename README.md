# Welcome to my website!!!

### This website is created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

#### External stylesheet has been used to style the webpage
#### Javascript has been used to make the navigation bar responsive
(I couldn't test this js responsive feature as it doesn't show the result on local machine. Only after hosting, the responsiveness can be seen.)

#### Few features implemented-
** `@media` css styling has been used to make the webpage cater to various screen sizes.
** contains hyperlinks to various sections inside the page for easy navigation.

### Validation perfomed:
CSS validated using- http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
HTML validated using- https://validator.w3.org/

### Drawbacks:

Screen resizing is working fine for all the divs except in the "about me", where the picture  is scaling incorrectly in smaller screen sizes. Couldn't fix the issue due to time constraint.
**Will be uploading the corrections soon..** 
*Keep checking my github for when I add more features and updations! Cheers!!*
